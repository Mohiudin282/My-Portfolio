                            My main skills? i'm really good with Typescript, Javascript, React, and Node.js. I also know my way around Nextjs, Expressjs, and a bunch of other cool libraries. I can make websites look great on any device. Oh, and i'm pretty handy with git for keeping track of all my code changes.
